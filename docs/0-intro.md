Introduction
============

Why
---
It soon becomes apparent that the tools I uses daily to help software
development could be better. I want to stick some agile scrum ideals, but also 
want to introduce using data driven system design. As well have the tool answer
a range of questions from differing audiences.

Who
---
So scrum defines four basic roles: Stakeholders, Product Owner, Scrum Master and
Dev's. I would like to allobrate on the devs and break them down into their
major skill, as this will reflect the different questions they have of the tool.
So the dev roles would be for example: tester, backend dev, frontend dev, 
designer etc. 

What
----
Scrum also has set meetings: Backlog refinement, Sprint Planning, Daily
standups, Sprint retrospective. So the tool should directly deal with these.
This will also help with remote work. Help with planning, the reasons for the
changes in the velocity of development and return on investments.

How
---
I think it's useful if a story can be broken times as many times as needed until
tasks fall out. The acceptance critria and time estimates should be split down 
with the broken down stories.
