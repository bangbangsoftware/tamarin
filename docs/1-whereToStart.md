Where to Start
==============

So there's two people in this project and it's gonna be in Angular2 and employ
material design. So one dev and one designer we are gonna create great things.
I want to build it as you would use it, so starting from logging on to moth 
balling the project.

Data In And Data Out
--------------------
So tamarin, will take in users and their answers, time, git log and spit out 
working software (with proof via tests) and documentation on how to install it,
use it and extend it. That's my starting design, my first story to breakdown, my
minimum viable product.

Dog Fooding
-----------
So I want to be recursive. I want to use this project to build this project. So
who is first to the table, in a scrum point of view? I would say the product
owner. So that backlog can established and the first sprint planned with the 
team.

Onward
------
So first is the log on screen, which I find a little boring, so maybe I
will use a service to do that for me. Also I considered have a Go backend, but
really my heart is there either, so I may just use firebase and have no backend.
The only problem I can see there is getting the git logs, can I get this
remotely? Does github let you read the logs? The again what about couch or mongo
through postgres.
